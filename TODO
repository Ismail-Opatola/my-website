There is an alternate way to use google form in order to make the design of your choice.

Here it goes:

Create the template of your choice using HTML5/ Responsive Web design in order to fit in any mobile or tablets.
Create a google form.
Check the source code of this form.
In your original code , write a post function on submit of the button or form(whatever you wish).
Then do an AJAX call where the url will be something like : https://docs.google.com/forms/d/...BgiRRtEA4d6Ifnvyh6-8/formResponse --- This URL you can find in the source code of the FORM you just created.(try finding with the name docs.google)
Then the data will be something like this:
data : {

"entry.341651702" : name,

"entry.2110349582" : mobile,

"entry.475347665" : email,

"entry.270046347" : query

}, --- Search for entry.XXXXXXX and use it as per your form details.

And you are done with your customized google form.

Here is a short example for the same:

HTML Code :

<!-- block for subscription-->

<div style="float:left;width:20%;">

Name

</div>

<input id="name-sub" type="text" placeholder="&nbsp;Name" />

</div>

<div>

<div >

Mobile No

</div>

<input id="mobile-sub" type="text" placeholder="&nbsp;Mobile No." />

</div>

<div>

<div>

Mail Id

</div>

<input id="mail-sub" type="email" placeholder="&nbsp;E-mail />

<br/>

<button class="button subscribe-done btn-success" id="subscribe-submit" onclick="postContactToGoogleSubscribe()" type="button" >

Subscribe

</button>

<button class="button subscribe-done" id="cancel" onclick="" type="button">

Cancel

</button>

Function and AJAX Calling:

function postContactToGoogleSubscribe() {

var email = $('#mail-sub').val();

var name = $('#name-sub').val();

var mobile = $('#mobile-sub').val();

$.ajax({

url : "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1MIDItVFCO9_2co_UlBgiRRtEA4d6Ifnvyh6-8/formResponse",

data : {

"entry.1238575226" : name,

"entry.1681546984" : mobile,

"entry.679631165" : email

},

type : "POST",

dataType : "xml"

});

Hope it helps.
